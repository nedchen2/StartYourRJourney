# Start Your R Journey



This tutorial was first designed for the purpose of Methods for Assessing Health Benefits in Functional Foods.

- The R Journey tutorial originated and inspired from the content from MSc in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution from Imperial College London.
- I appreciate Dr. Samraat Pawar for his great help during my master study.
