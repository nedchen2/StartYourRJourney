# Welcome to your R programming journey 



This tutorial was first designed for the *Methods for Assessing Health Benefits in Functional Foods* (at University of Eastern Finland), but will be used elsewhere if necessary.

- The R Journey tutorial originated and inspired from the content from MSc in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution from Imperial College London. I appreciate Dr. Samraat Pawar for his great help during my master study.

- Please complete the Chapter 1 before doing Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 

- We currently support two main topics (Depending on my time availability, the notebook may be updated.)

  - 1. Biological Computing in Base R
       - Chapter 1
       - Chapter 2
  - 2.  Sequencing-based Microbiome Analysis in R
       - Chapter 3
