# Welcome to your R programming journey 

This tutorial was first designed for the purpose of Methods for Assessing Health Benefits in Functional Foods (University of Eastern Finland).

- The R Journey tutorial originated and inspired from the content from MSc in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution from Imperial College London.
- I appreciate Dr. Samraat Pawar for his great help during my master study.
